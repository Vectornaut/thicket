=== Title ===

Visualizing neutral theory

=== Abstract ===

In this expository talk, I'll use 1d voter models to illustrate basic features of neutral theoryâ€”a vision of how genetic and ecological diversity can emerge even without selective pressure. We'll see how questions about the persistence and spatial organization of lineages can be rephrased, in these models, as questions about random walks. I'm not an expert on any of the things I'll be talking about, so I'm looking forward to learning as much from you as I hope you will from me.
