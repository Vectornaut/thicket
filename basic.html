    <div>This is the family tree of a single cell, branching downward through the generations. Each new cell descends from one of its neighbors in the last generation. A coin flip decides whether it descends from the left or from the right. It inherits its ancestor&rsquo;s color, often with a little drift. A little drift adds up over time. As the colors become more vivid, your eyes might start to group them. You&rsquo;ll tend to see group boundaries where neighboring cells&rsquo; lineages have been separated for a long time.
